And it was like that all around the moon: a vast, endless ocean. Plate-tectonics were nearly non-existent, and erosion had taken care of the rest. From what handhold could life start? &nbsp;There were no warm tidal pools for different chemicals to mingle and coalesce; no hydrothermal vents spewing out nutrients and heat. &nbsp;Arethusa was a gigantic three-dimensional wet desert, empty of life in all three cardinal directions, a volume both formless and featureless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had manned the sonars as we probed the empty depths from the surface.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The tides were strong, in theory, but with almost no shoreline to crash against this was more of a technicality than anything else. &nbsp;Any intelligent life that did evolve here probably wouldn&rsquo;t notice the sea level raise six times what it did every day on Earth. &nbsp;Gas giant parents will do that to moons. The Arethusian days were long, 60 hours nearly, with extra dark due to frequent, long eclipses. The days were, in fact, too long for a sleep-adjustment drug regimen to counter, instead those of us who stayed any amount of time on Arethusa were unsynced with the local days and did their best to keep to earth. &nbsp;In theory, being unsynced was better for our job - we would be able to move anywhere around the moon without worrying about keeping to the solar day. &nbsp;But we had moved barely a quarter of the way around the moon in the last couple of years - what reason would there be to be anywhere else?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And this is why I&rsquo;m dispirited. No lifeforms, and all day on a boat which keeps me permanently sea sick. &nbsp;You know when you spend some time on a boat and you return to dry land on Earth and it feels like you&rsquo;re still on the boat? Imagine that but instead of dry land it&rsquo;s 0g, after a violent reorbiting excursion. While finding a type of plankton unique to Arethusa wouldn&rsquo;t excite me much directly, it would give some purpose to this world - a place of scientific curiosity, a note in the history books. And more visitors to this damn world. &nbsp;My being here should be the starting sentence of a long history volume. &nbsp;But we&rsquo;ll probably need to turn the lights out when we leave for good. &nbsp;One of the first humans on a alien planet you may say. &nbsp;But the totality of experiences on this world was but a tiny subset of those at home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I sat on the edge of the vessel, my drysuited feed brushing the water. I wanted to strip off this heavy suit, throw away my mask and jump in. Only a few millimeters of rubber was a barrier between me and the alien world. I had contemplated doing it in the last couple of months. There was more life living on me than there was life in nearest 10 light years. Sure - if I was caught the consequences for me would be severe, i&rsquo;d be on the first ship home with no hope of leaving earth for the rest of my life - but the impact on the future of this planet could be tremendous. &nbsp;Imagine being mother or father to an entire biology. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That is if life could take hold. Looking out over the endless sea, clouds hovering over the horizon I couldn&rsquo;t imagine anything more sterile, barren or hostile to life. I nature couldn&rsquo;t form lie here in five billion years, it&rsquo;s unlikely some human-adapted bacteria would be able to start life. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I found myself daydreaming about life often, but I also imagined death. &nbsp;Tying weights around myself and falling into the waves. &nbsp;I would fall, drifting twisting turning for several hours before I hit the solid ground at the bottom, so long as currents didn&rsquo;t prolong the inevitable. &nbsp;I imagined my arms crossed across my body, falling further and further. &nbsp;Only a tiny fraction of that abyssal journey would be visible - the sheer volume of the water above me blocking out light. &nbsp;The pressure would get more nightmarishly intense. My lungs would have exploded, if only my descent were real. &nbsp;The dark and the pressure was like a blanket, constricting me, while buoyancy and gravity pulled me ever on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I wasn&rsquo;t depressed, but muted from the world. &nbsp;Yet, I yearned to fall. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t explain it. &nbsp;Nothing was pushing me, but like entropy or osmosis, it felt like the natural order of things. &nbsp;My floating here was just resisting the natural state of things - rubber and metal blockading me from the real.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was three days later. &nbsp;We were navigating next up to the one of the few volcanic islands on this world. &nbsp;A large archipelago of black rock, scattered around the circumference of an ancient dead volcano. &nbsp;It was busy work: every single one of the skeleton crew on this planet was occupied navigating or on lookout. The sea was choppy; the skies were dark and a storm brewing. &nbsp;I manned the sonar, keeping an eye on the jagged rocks that loomed out of the sea. The captain commanded that we make toward a sheltered bay. &nbsp;It was high tide - we had to do it soon. The vehicle we were on was inconvenient and unwieldy to steer, not really designed for this crazy excursion. We needed a base for our guests who were coming to study these rocks, and we couldn&rsquo;t wait nearby without endangering the ships integrity. &nbsp;I kept one eye glued to the sonar read out. &nbsp;My other eye was on the storm clouds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Soon, I had a rope between my hands. Feet planted in grooves of the black rock. &nbsp;There were several others on this rope, and two other manned ropes to my left. &nbsp;&ldquo;Heave!&rdquo; was the chorus. &nbsp;I threw myself backwards, arms strianing. &nbsp;The vessel shifted forward with the crash of a wave. &nbsp;I fell back onto the black rock, with a flash of pain up my leg. &nbsp;The rock was wet from the spray. &nbsp;&lsquo;Ready!&rsquo; called out the captain, and I struggled to my feet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sky lit up with a flash. &nbsp;Dazzled, I wrapped the rope around my left hand. &lsquo;Heave!&rsquo; and the sky exploded with noise. &nbsp;I fell back for the second time. &nbsp;The vessel lurched onto the rock. &nbsp;Now nearly clear of the waves, we were able to pull steadily, and soon had moved it up to a suitable resting location. &nbsp;The vessel was designed to float. &nbsp;But if we were to make this remnant volcano our base, we couldn&rsquo;t station it around the subsurface rocks with the threat of storms and ten metre tides.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Sneaking away from the rest of the team, I tucked into double portions that evening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The next few days were more enjoyable. &nbsp;The secondary science team were imminent, so I had a tasked myself with making the area as functionable and presentable as possible. &nbsp;On dry land, as unfriendly as it was to clamber over, at least gave me space to move. &nbsp;Some of what had been stored inside could now come out: boxes of supplies, tanks of water, electronic equipment were now perched on this outcropping or that boulder. There was peace as well: only myself and two others - one steward like myself, and one of the scientists - were on the surface. &nbsp;The rest of the team had headed back to the orbiting ship awaiting the arrival of our guests.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had been on this planet for nearly two years now. The thought of interacting with new, different personalities and quirks was both exciting and dreadful. &nbsp;I barely thought I could articulate myself properly. &nbsp;Although we had received messages from them on their journey, they were utilitarian, mission-focussed texts. &nbsp;Computer read-outs, weather forecasts, orbital parameters. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d now have to chat, make small talk. And what was there to chat about? My experiences on this world - but what experience was that?. &nbsp;I felt I was like this rock I was on. &nbsp;A small, sharp, solid object surrounded by an eternity of undifferentiated nothingness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Chores were purposeful, so clean and prepare I did. &nbsp;I ticked off one thing after another, mildly astonished by all the things we had let slip over the last months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All the preparations that had been in place were stalled because of jet lag. &nbsp;The expedition team, after waking up from their hibernation 6 weeks ago, had fallen into an awake/sleep pattern that was a) completely incompatible with the time we were living and b) much longer than earth - &nbsp;20 hours awake followed by 15 hour sleeps. &nbsp;They spent over a week docked with our orbiting ship growing accustomed to our proper time. &nbsp;They said they didn&rsquo;t know what the time would be on Arethusa. &nbsp;My Captain had responded that there is no one time on Arethusa, it was all times at once! &nbsp;We made our own time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Each day of the delay I tidied some more. &nbsp;On the final day, itchy with anticipation, I took a wander over the small archipelago. &nbsp;It was my afternoon, but the sun was just rising. At low tide the islands had revealed themselves again being conjoined; a tremendous upturned black claw. &nbsp;This ritual undressing of the island every few hours was the most organic thing I had experienced in my entire time here. &nbsp;Water bubbled and foamed at the borders of the solid and liquid domains. Staying well away from the water&rsquo;s edge, but walking on the new treacherous paths the sea had revealed, I clambered from the larger island we were stationed on, out over to by my reckoning the farthest point from it. &nbsp;If asked, I would say I was surveying the area. &nbsp;And there was an element of practicality to this. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d had a detailed satellite map of the world even before we commenced our deceleration burn into the system - but this was largely 2d. &nbsp;Perhaps there was a cave or other covered-over area to explore, hidden from the sky. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was in my head daydreaming for a second. A crash of a wave brought me back to reality. &nbsp;Looking around briefly (and not at my feet) the area was desolate and raw, devoid of any quality of intrigue or mystery. &nbsp;There was no practical need to explore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Finally, after a couple hours of clambering, I had reached as far away from the vessel as the land would allow me. &nbsp;Possibly three kilometers around the dead caldera, although my route was not really measurable in purely one direction. &nbsp;Much of the rock was wrinkled at a human-unfriendly height. &nbsp;A true measure of the distance would pull each end of the journey and flatten the wrinkles - probably adding 3x the distance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Why? I don&rsquo;t really know. &nbsp;I felt a kind of tension, or built up pressure within me. &nbsp;This is how I let some of that pressure spill out. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">I took a rest on the rock and ate a portion. &nbsp;It was cumbersome taking off my rebreather, taking a few bites, then putting my rebreather back on. &nbsp;Arethusa had insufficient levels of oxygen even with the thick atmosphere, but taking off the mask briefly wasn&rsquo;t deadly. The awkwardness of the procedure and meant I was clumsy and dropped the last half of the packet. I reached out to grab it, but I was too late, it was falling quickly down the path of least resistance and disappeared into the crashing waves. &nbsp;Litter. &nbsp;Lost into the world for ever now. &nbsp; The packet was made from a kind of extremely resistant supermaterial called </span><span class="c3 c7">polyethylene</span><span class="c1">, picked for these extrasolar missions because of it&rsquo;s remarkable properties. &nbsp;Light, flexible strong, and a perfect boundary maintained between the human and the untouched natural world. &nbsp;The food contained within - a potential but unlikely contaminant, would disappear ten-thousand years before the wrapper did. &nbsp;I hoped no-one else from the team noticed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I headed back to the vessel, my spirit of adventure dwindling. &nbsp;Clambering back the way I came - at least I think it was the way I came - I made slow progress back up the ridge immediately behind where I had taken my rest. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Silently, a shadow crossed the water, and the world darkened. &nbsp;An eclipse. &nbsp;In a short period of time, the gas giant had passed between me and the sun, illuminating a crescent of the atmosphere of the larger planet. &nbsp;And then it was truly dark. &nbsp;The semi regular eclipses of the gas giant were nothing to be surprised about, but I had totally forgotten about this when I took the trip out. &nbsp;The sky had been clear too - and looking out I could see the milky way stretched out across the sky. &nbsp;Only a large, purely black area was devoid of stars near the horizon - the direction where the gas giant, taking up as much as the sky as a dinner plate held at arm&#39;s length during the day. &nbsp; In the sky I could see a couple of the smaller moons illuminated as half-crescents, and the some of the thin ring that surrounded the gas giant. &nbsp;The ring was in the process of being made - an asteroid caught at the roche limit was fragmenting apart, leaving a spindle of a ring behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The darkness would last the best part of an hour. While dry rocks were warm, the world was suddenly much cooler. And more hostile. &nbsp;I took out the headlamp I had in my bag and put it on. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t stay where I was, this interruption could mean I the tides make the last part of my journey impossible. &nbsp;In the dark, I made slow, deliberate movements, but I was making progress. &nbsp;At times, I could see the vessel - my destination - lit up in the distance. &nbsp;My legs and arms ached, my grip weakening, but worst was the strain on my vision. &nbsp;With light projected from myself, shadows took on a dynamic, lurching form as I passed from rocky outcropping here to boulder there. &nbsp;My imagination - really just a prediction engine - was overclocking. &nbsp;Was behind that shadow just a small divot? Or a hole I could get lost in? With the fatigue in addition, I panicked. &nbsp;Each movement I made was difficult - but most difficult was that it didn&rsquo;t let up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had made it to a ridge. &nbsp;Here, it was easier going, and I remembered clambering up it on the way out. &nbsp;I could almost take it at walking speed. &nbsp;From this vantage, I could see the terminator of the eclipse - the sunlight shooting across the ocean ahead. &nbsp;It was so bright! One cannot conceive of the sheer power of light when in the dark. &nbsp;The terminator made quick, silent progress across the sea, and soon all was bathed in light. &nbsp;I closed my eyes, squinting as they ached, raising an arm above my eyes, stumbling onward. &nbsp;Stumbling onward - and then falling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I crashed down on my front. &nbsp;My heart was thumping. &nbsp;I prepared myself for a flood of pain - but none came. &nbsp;I dizzy; light-headed. &nbsp;I felt hungry? Or maybe thirsty? What a strange time to feel thirsty. Thirsty for&hellip; not water, no. &nbsp;Breath. &nbsp;I felt thirsty for breath. &nbsp;I was winded, but breathing. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s the problem? &nbsp;Piercing through the sound of the waves, I could hear a curious noise, like a snake. &nbsp;Hissing. &nbsp;The hissing of&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I moved my head, then my eyes, looking down my body. &nbsp;The tube connecting my ventilator to the pressurised O2 tank was sticking through an rocky spike. &nbsp;Fuck. &nbsp;This is serious. Half of me was happy to lay here. &nbsp;But some distant but very authoritative voice was telling me to move. &nbsp;Get up. Fix it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With an almighty effort, I was able to pick myself up. &nbsp;As I got up, I was shaking. &nbsp;The serious voice was squashed out by a scream. &nbsp;&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t fix this, you will die.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had a tube bandage in my bag. &nbsp;Throwing my bag off, tearing the contents out onto the rock, I fell on to my hands and knees to rummage through a litany of objects that I barely recognised. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was hyperventilating now. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t breathe quick enough to get what I need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I found the tape. &nbsp;With violently shaking hands, I applied the tape, wrapping it round and round the wound. I sat down, nearly collapsing. &nbsp;Breathing in, and out. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know if it was working - there was no sudden flush of relief. Gradually, my body was telling me that it was satisfied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I felt better a couple of minutes later. &nbsp;I reapplied the tape, much more cleanly now. &nbsp;I redundantly wrapped the entire roll of tape around the entire length of the tube. &nbsp;I sat where I was for a long time, i&#39;m not sure how long. &nbsp;The sun was getting higher in the sky, and it was getting very warm. &nbsp;Every single cell in my body ached, and I had a full, banging headache. &nbsp;My heart thumped. &nbsp;On top of it all, I felt embarrassed and ashamed. &nbsp;I had nearly died, for nothing, because I was being careless. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I slowly made my way back to the vessel. &nbsp;I surreptitiously threw the damaged tube in the waste storage, and lay on my bunk. &nbsp;Adrenaline meant I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. &nbsp;I lay there all night, dwelling on the event.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I stirred. There was a weight on my chest, and a vibrating, humming noise. &nbsp;My body ached from where I had fallen. Was that weight another symptom of my fall? There was commotion outside the room. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I tried to put my hand to my chest. A furball got in the way - one that promptly made a noise. A cat. &nbsp;Sitting up, the cat jumped onto the floor with staccato thumps, and made its way through the ajar door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I looked at my device, I had slept in much longer than I had in months. &nbsp;The commotion outside the room, and the voices I didn&rsquo;t recognise, showed that the new team had arrived. &nbsp;Getting up took an enormous effort, but I got and and gingerly introduced myself. &nbsp;I knew their profiles from long back, but I couldn&rsquo;t put name to face and had trouble remembering them after they repeated it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c8">Yn&eacute;s</span><span class="c3">, leader of the team of new scientist, is the arrival I found myself most drawn to over the coming days. Chatting felt unnatural for me at the moment, but </span><span class="c3 c8">Yn&eacute;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;seemed to understand what I meant, even if I barely could get the words out. She also brought a renewed optimism - an optimism that had been sculpted by the expectations we had set for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After the formal introductions, long unnecessary meetings, chatting over dinner in the makeshift eating area was nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">She was planning an excursion, one that I also was drawn to. &nbsp;They had brought an array of &lsquo;toys&rsquo; with them, ranging from a mobile base, a submarine and helicopter. &nbsp;I was slightly gutted I hadn&rsquo;t seen their atmospheric entry - most of the equipment came in a heat-shielded, collapsible skin. All except for the submarine -- built to withstand the immense pressures - was deorbited naked. &nbsp;A black, bulbous submarine falling from the sky</span><span class="c3 c6">[</span><span class="c3 c6 c15"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D3q7TFaIn968%26list%3DPLcll4Jfd6h6ixw-IOWPnJKQ7pPGpDVS_P&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1557953871607000">1</a></span><span class="c3 c6">]</span><span class="c3">, glowing red with the pressure of entry - (and it was pressure </span><span class="c3 c7">not</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;friction causing the warming, reiterated the captain, &lsquo;remember the ideal gas law from school!&rsquo;), was a sight to behold. &nbsp;It splashed into the ocean, a couple of parachutes barely having an effect, steam hissing up from from the bow. &nbsp;This is what I hear second hand, anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This had been the preferred structure of xenovisits - send a small team out first, who would coordinate an appropriate second team, scouting ahead so they knew what to bring. &nbsp;The B teams&rsquo; habitable vessel was moored a kilometer or so out from the islands. &nbsp;It rested in place thanks to a complicated anchoring system, that meant that it wouldn&rsquo;t drift or be endangered by the rocks, whilst keeping afloat of the tides. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">I volunteered myself to accompany the submarine excursion. &nbsp;I had been on Arethusa&rsquo;s surface the most, so I was given preference when I asked. &nbsp;I think a couple of the A team thought I was crazy. Most of the &lsquo;science&rsquo; which was going to happen was data collection, the human occupants there to gently guide it and check on the systems. &nbsp;Y would be in charge, and myself and another of the B team were going, T, who like me seemed closed off and uninterested in conversation. &nbsp;Lei was a geologist, while </span><span class="c3 c8">Yn&eacute;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;a xenobiologist. &nbsp;Geology was generally low on the priority list of scientific enquiry for new worlds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A day or so preparation - and then we were sealing ourselves inside the thick hull of the submarine. Twisting shut the airlock, I felt strangely like I was back orbit, although here gravity kept my feet firmly where they should be. I felt some relief sealing myself away in here. &nbsp;A nuclear bomb could go off below us and we&rsquo;d live. There weren&rsquo;t any windows, as they would need to be so thick to to be useless. &nbsp;Rather, the sub was equipped with an array of cameras and other sensors, and big screens to view it all on. &nbsp;Alf, the B teams cat, had also leapt into the sub before I could shut it. &nbsp;Alf had been chief ratter of the B teams ship now in orbit, but it was unlikely he would catch anything down here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The descent was slow. &nbsp;On the screens, the outside view of the sub was visible. &nbsp;Huge, fullbeam torches illuminated the rocks sloping away to infinity in front of us, the wrinkles twisting and mingling with each other. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8">Yn&eacute;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;guided us, following this crevasse or that. &nbsp;The controls were tricky - she&rsquo;d only used them in a simulator - but an autopilot would kick-in if we got into real trouble. &nbsp;Bubbles shot over the cameras. &nbsp;We kept descending - and the water got thicker and more impenetrable. &nbsp;Sonar pinged away, also guiding us. &nbsp;The engines hummed all around. &nbsp;One kilometer down. &nbsp;Then two kilometers. &nbsp;Three - and the surface plateaued out - now we headed only forwards. &nbsp;On the sonar, the near surface was clearly discernible. &nbsp;Also what was discernible was that, imminently, the ground below us would give way. &nbsp;I could just make out the sandy, murky surface of Arethusa through the gloom. &nbsp;Certainly nothing that looked organic here. &nbsp;Then we glided over the edge of a cliff - the ground gave way into a void of pure blackness below us. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The noises from the engines changed, as we came to a stop (according to the sonar), turned the sub around to face the cliff edge, and a new rumble started as a different set of rotors started turning. &nbsp;We lurched downwards, the full beams blasting the rock in front of us with light. &nbsp;4km, 5 km, the screen readout kept increasing. &nbsp;I wondered how much more there was to descend - how much empty depth there was below us. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure Y knew, but I daren&rsquo;t ask. &nbsp;Whatever she said, there was nothing I could do with that information and it would make me anxious. &nbsp;It struck me how effortful it was to descend at any reasonable pace. &nbsp;It was if the world was resisting our exploration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">At seven and a half km, we stopped. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t see - but </span><span class="c3 c8">Yn&eacute;s </span><span class="c3">assured us that this vertical portion was over. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8">Yn&eacute;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and Lei took some time to make some readings, write things down. The engine was off. &nbsp;For maybe 30 minutes we were motionless in the silence, every so often a &lsquo;mmhmm&rsquo; or other human noise piercing the emptiness. &nbsp;Alf sat on my lap, and I stroked him while I waited. &nbsp;Every so often there was a metallic clank, alerting alf.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">A tremendous, deep creaking sound rattled the sub. &nbsp;My eyes opened wide and looked at </span><span class="c3 c8">Yn&eacute;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- what is that?! &nbsp;Lei suggested we get moving - likely related to the volcanic activity. Being a the bottom of a kilometers-tall cliff meant falling debris was possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Five minutes later we were moving again, and I felt a lot more comfortable as the engine started up. We turned back away from the cliff, and onwards out on to the continental shelf. &nbsp;We were descending again, but at quite a slow rate. After a couple of hours we hit 10km, then an hour after that 12 km. &nbsp;The ship had ranked several spots as important based off the sonar, and we would check every one. There was a new cliff starting here, but the sonar betrayed it was little more than a trench, curving through the seabed that was several meters away from us. &nbsp;Staying above the trench, but diving down every so often, we made several other stops, diving down into the trench to take readings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">At the third stop, </span><span class="c3 c8">Yn&eacute;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;dramatically dropped her device. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve discovered the remnants of life. &nbsp;It died out here, maybe 3 million years ago, when the planet was more geologically active.&rdquo; &nbsp;The fact that the life was dead didn&rsquo;t peturb me as much as I thought. &nbsp;It was still an incredible thing to discover. &nbsp;The creatures - probably microscopic in size - had made the heat and chemicals from undersea vents their ecosystem. &nbsp;But it was unlikely they were ever able to adapt to the desert around them, and when as the core of the planet cooled, they died off. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">We retreated vertically out of the trench, hovering above it. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8">Yn&eacute;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;flipped upon a section on the joystick she was holding. &nbsp;Flipping the switch several times on and off, the entire sea bed flashed in a strobe. &nbsp;The trench - with gnarly jaws of rock either side, with the bottom illuminated. &nbsp;There were what looked like stacks of rock jutting out of the trench. &nbsp;Beyond the trench, snaking below us, was undisturbed sand, with boulders leering out of the blackness. &nbsp;The entire scene was bathed in a ghostly whiteness. &nbsp; This may be the only light that has touched these objects ever. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It took half a day to resurface.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Over the course of the next few weeks, more excursions happened. &nbsp;Longer, multi-day trips with more of the science team. &nbsp;The entire area around the volcano was full of extinct life, all clustered around various hot water vents. &nbsp;There was a suggestion that some of the colonies were biologically distinct from the others. &nbsp;This was an incredible hypothesis - life starting more than once showed how easy biogenisis was in some environments. &nbsp;But it also betrayed the fact that this life was limited in its ability to spread. &nbsp;Life would not have started again on earth, as the incumbent life had taken grip - laying claim to the chemicals and nutrients for itself. &nbsp;Life on Arethusa - a plurality, and past tense, had failed to this. Who was to say the situation on Arethusa was abnormal - that life had failed after the first step, unable to prosper - or that this is the normal, expected course of events and that earth life had been an anomaly. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8">Yn&eacute;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;had been working on a theory that life would wake up and die out with the variations of activity from the core of the moon. &nbsp;Gravitational interactions with the rest of the system could provide energy into the system in a way unrelated to the gradual cooling of the interior of the moon. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were lots of theories thrown around at dinner, however, and not all of them could be correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">One thing that was mentioned casually by Lei was that there was a suggestion that the volcano may be starting to become active again soon. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8">Yn&eacute;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;reminded me that &lsquo;soon&rsquo; meant different things to geologists than it does to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I did not return to the depths of the sea. &nbsp;I enjoyed the bite-sized summaries of the latest discoveries and theories; like gossip about a half-forgotten acquaintance. It felt like before the B team arrived. Some of the A team went back up to the orbiting ships, picked up by the shuttlecrafts that were kept docked on to the ship. &nbsp;They were organising de-orbiting the rest of the B-teams more delicate equipment, more tools, habitation units, supplies and more for a much longer science survey. &nbsp;Some of this was brought down by shuttle but a lot was deorbited encased in the same material as the vessel I was now standing on. &nbsp;I busied myself unpacking and sorting out this equipment. There was a power arm, really more of a crane, that helped with the heaviest parts. &nbsp;When I was done with it, it would be attached to the submarine to help their investigation. I&rsquo;m pretty sure the guys in space had thrown down everything that wasn&rsquo;t bolted down without discrimination, and as such there was plenty for me to do. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The vessel had gradually turned from a bare-bones, utilitarian habitation area, to a multi-layered, sprawling home. &nbsp;It was satisfying to have &lsquo;built&rsquo; this - although really I had slotted this prefabricated panel into that joint, or merged two separate areas together. &nbsp;Alf had made the place his home, and I had laid down some carpets which he would flop over on and absorb sunlight. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t tell how the long days affected him - i&rsquo;m not sure if he noticed at all. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One morning I had woken up in the dark, and I was sucking down coffee to kick-start my day. I was idly watching the cat jump from some of the kitchen equipment, up on to the trays that were suspended from the ceiling carrying wires and pipes. &nbsp;He followed the tray to the wall, where he was able to knock open a loose metal barrier and go into the room beyond. &nbsp;I knew it was a store room, but I had never actually been in it. The B team had brought that part down with their original vessel. I wanted to see what alf was doing, partly to make sure he wasn&rsquo;t intruding on anything important, and partly because, well, why not?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I realised that the entrance to the room wasn&rsquo;t immediately obvious. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t directly attached to a corridor, I had to enter through two adjoining storage areas. &nbsp;When finally I opened the door to the storage room, I saw Alf perched on the edge of a large aquarium, looking down into the illuminated contents. The tank must have taken up half the room. Suspended in the water were ghostly, almost transparent creatures: jellyfish. &nbsp;Their legs floating out either side of them, they looked like fresh plastic trash that I had seen in films at school. &nbsp;There were innumerable creatures in the tank - hints of blue, pink and purple. &nbsp;The water was busy with bubbles, dirt or spores intermingling with the rest of it. &nbsp;I was transfixed for a moment, like the cat, staring at the alien curiousness of it all. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And yet, jellies weren&rsquo;t beautiful. &nbsp;They were a nuisance problem, a silent plague that swept the seas of earth. &nbsp;While humans had been able to destroy habitat after habitat of forest or jungle into farmland then desert, destroying ecosystems completely - the same couldn&rsquo;t be said for the oceans. &nbsp;Sure, fish, plankton and other life was easily caught, poisoned or starved, jellies rose from the metaphorical ashes of these systems, barely alive themselves. &nbsp;Jellies served no purpose for humans, so there was no economical reason to keep them. &nbsp;But they persisted, perhaps because of their ghostly qualities rather than in spite of them, memories of vibrant ecosystems now gone. &nbsp;Like ghosts, they were formless, floating. &nbsp;Like ghosts, many jellies would never die. &nbsp;And jellies could spread easily. &nbsp;Huge numbers would intrude into a new pocket of water, the life who&rsquo;s home it was would be suffocated out. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the bottom of the aquarium I noticed fish bones sticking out of the sand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had intruded. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure if I was meant to know this was here - their&hellip; science experiment? &nbsp;I grabbed alf, and closed all the doors behind us. and spent a couple of hours fixing up the metal panel and others around the vessel. &nbsp;Not that alf could really hurt them - im sure they would come out the winner if he went for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Six weeks later we were having a meeting about what a C team would need. &nbsp;If they came - this would be a much bigger team. &nbsp;Lei interrupted us during the meeting, in a panic. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The volcano - is active again&rdquo;. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We rushed over to the window, and could see a huge plume of black smoke rising from the archipelago. &nbsp;We did a head count - was anyone on the smaller vessel still beached on the larger island?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were five on the sub. &nbsp;Ten in orbit. &nbsp;Seven here. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s everyone? Oh, me. 24 of us. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Looking back out to the window, the ploom of smoke was slightly bigger, and larger island had rocks sliding down into the ocean. &nbsp;The vessel shook laterally, and I grabbed on to the window.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Protocol said only one thing. We were to abandon the planet surface.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One of the shuttles was dispatched from orbit. It picked up the 6 of them - leaving me here. &nbsp;I volunteered to wait for the sub team to surface. &nbsp;Communicating with them below the surface was nearly impossible, all I could do was wait. &nbsp;They should have returned maybe half a day ago, but many times the away teams had been much longer than planned. &nbsp;Alf kept me company - but what could I do? There was the threat that they had become endangered by the shifting rocks. The deep, booming sound we had experienced in the sub the first time came back to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All data had been backed up. Samples had been evacuated. &nbsp;What else was there to protect? &nbsp;Pacing round the vessel, I didn&rsquo;t find anything that was worth saving. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But what about the jellies?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I hadn&rsquo;t asked about them, and no-one had mentioned them. &nbsp;They felt like my own secret. &nbsp;I found my way back to the storage room, all doors except the one before it were open. &nbsp;I stood in front of them, caught up in the strangeness of it all. &nbsp;Alf had followed me, oblivious to the panic. &nbsp;I picked him up - I wanted to make sure he didn&rsquo;t wander off so I could evacuate him easily. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I took a laser tool from another part of the ship. &nbsp;Putting on my drysuit, I climbed into the tank. &nbsp;Pulling myself down, my head was submerged and tentacle after tentacle dragged past my visor. &nbsp;Using the glass sides of the tank to orient myself, I fired up the laser tool at the bottom of the tank. &nbsp;The water heated up. &nbsp;I pressed the end of the gun to the bottom of the tank. &nbsp;It made quick work of the thick metal. &nbsp;Water started draining out. &nbsp;I drew a circle with the gun, and the floor fell through. &nbsp;A six inch gap was there, and the water drained through quickly. &nbsp;Jellie after jellie slipped through the hole, algae, food slipped through with it. &nbsp;There was a 5 meter drop from the hole into the ocean below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Realising that I had no way out of the near empty tank, I lasered the joints of the glass, and knocked it over, glass shattered everywhere. &nbsp;Alf bolted. &nbsp;The storage room had containers lining the walls. Dried food, dried eggs. &nbsp;I unscrewed lids, cut open polythene, and threw them all through the hole after the water. &nbsp;Finally, I took the laser tool to the wiring. &nbsp;As expected, the devices on the wall lit up red. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The shuttle craft returned shortly before the sub resurfaced. &nbsp;The rock bed had shifted up sand and dust as they were studying it, disorientating the ships sensors. &nbsp;They knew there were problems and had headed to the surface as soon as it settled. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One of the scientists questioned me why I was wearing a drysuit. &nbsp;Before I had time to think of an answer, we were hurried to to grab what little we could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Strapped in the shuttle craft, it used the ocean as a runway. &nbsp;I was thrown into the back of my seat as we re-orbited with the conjoined ships. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Both human habitats were sending out warning messages. &nbsp;Uninhabitable. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Twenty four hours later, we were submerging ourselves in the hibernation gel. &nbsp;Next stop: Earth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">Epilogue</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The society that those explorers had been a part of faded into history, like a the sea retreating after a the crash of a wave. &nbsp;Cultures would come and go from the system over the millennia - but the deep blue marble of Arethusa was ignored. &nbsp;The universe was full of useful planets, in one way or another. &nbsp;Arethusa wasn&rsquo;t useful. &nbsp;Living off-planet is hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">200 thousand years had passed since the last proper activity of only volcano on Arethusa. &nbsp;Compared to movements of magma within Arethusa - something any ordinary human would consider to be rock solid, and only fluid on long enough time-spans, 200 thousand years was negligible; ignorable. &nbsp;Only humans find such times long.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rediscovered for the fifth time, a troubled colony ship entered the 201905NCG system and sought out the third largest moon of the gas giant, a reassuringly mundane world with the bare essentials to help Earth life live. &nbsp;Landing on a small island chain. &nbsp;Large enough to support heads, so long as we could make use of the water to create food from. A small expedition team landed to determine if the unnamed world could support their crew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The land was black, apocalyptic, like hell had cooled over. &nbsp;Setting down equipment, they pulled on drysuits and goggles and reapplied their breathing apparatus. &nbsp;Looking out over the ocean stretching out before them, there was little to note despite being an alien world - perhaps never been stood upon by humankind before. &nbsp;Not that they considered themselves &lsquo;only&rsquo; human.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wading into a bay area, each one of the team ducked their heads under the water. &nbsp;One held out a scanner before them, hand outstretched. &nbsp;It was designed to detect trace organic compounds. &nbsp;Swimming onwards, they too found that the ground slowly beneath them. &nbsp;There was no real sand to talk about, the water was clear, with the sun directly above them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On they swam. &nbsp;The sensor was picking up mild readings of this and that - positive suggestions of life-amenable compounds, but nothing groundbreaking. &nbsp;They were soon out above a much deeper area. &nbsp;The ground had fallen away into the depths. &nbsp;Looking down, they could no longer see the seabed, light did not penetrate far enough, even in these clear waters. &nbsp;Out of the dark loomed a thing, detectable more by it&rsquo;s movements than it&rsquo;s physical presence. &nbsp;Like a cloud forming, it came up from the loom, almost imperceptibly. &nbsp;It was not one thing - it was a thing made of many different parts. &nbsp;Ghostly, as if they were made out water itself, a school of ghostly, alien creatures moving chaotically yet somehow also in unison came rising up. &nbsp;Legs, tentacles arms or antennae floated in imperceptible currents, as if they were responding to our presence. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From dead above, the colony ships sensors saw a shadow forming entirely around their adventurers, growing in clarity as it rose to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><div><p class="c4"><span class="c11"></span></p></div></body></html>
